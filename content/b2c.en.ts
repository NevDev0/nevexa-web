  questions: [
    {
      id: 1,
      question: "What is the actual delivery timeline?",
      answer: "Typical delivery takes 6-8 weeks from order confirmation to port arrival. This includes vehicle sourcing, inspection, export documentation, and ocean freight. Door-to-door delivery adds 1-2 weeks depending on your location.",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "How do I know the vehicle is in good condition?",
      answer: "Every vehicle undergoes a comprehensive pre-shipment inspection by certified technicians. We provide a detailed inspection report with photos. If the vehicle doesn't meet our standards, we don't ship it.",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "What happens if the vehicle arrives damaged?",
      answer: "All shipments are fully insured. If damage occurs during transit, we file a claim immediately and work with you to resolve it. Pre-shipment and arrival photos document the vehicle's condition at each step.",
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "Why import instead of buying locally?",
      answer: "Importing from Canada gives you access to recent 2021-2026 models with verified history and competitive pricing. Local markets often have limited recent inventory with inflated prices, especially for premium vehicles.",
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "Can I request a specific model not shown here?",
      answer: "Yes. The catalog shows sample configurations, but we can source any 2021-2026 model from official dealerships. Contact us with your requirements and we'll provide a custom quote within 48 hours.",
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "Do you deliver to my country?",
      answer: "We currently ship to West African countries including Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Benin, Togo, and Ghana. Contact us to confirm availability for your specific destination and discuss delivery options.",
    },
